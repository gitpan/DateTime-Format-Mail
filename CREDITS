CREDITS

Here is a list of people and their CPAN id, extracted from various
places.  These people have either submitted patches or suggestions,
or their bug reports or comments have inspired the appropriate
patches.  Corrections, additions, deletions welcome:


By Philippe Bruhat  (BOOK)

* Julian Mehnle (JMEHNLE) for reporting that day name is optional, even
  with strict parsing. Fixed during Dave Rolsky (DROLSKY) maintainership.

* Neil Bowers (NEILB) for starting a CPAN-curating trend that led me to
  look for modules to adopt. DateTime::Format::Mail was the first one.

* IKEDA Soji (NEZUMI) for noting the difference between "-0000" and "+0000"
  in the timezone and that the usual format for days in the RFC examples
  didn't have a leading "0".


By Iain Truskett (SPOON)

* Dave Rolsky (DROLSKY) for kickstarting the DateTime project.

* Roderick A. Anderson for noting where the documentation was incomplete
  in places.

* Joshua Hoblitt (JHOBLITT) for inspiring me to check what the
  standard said about interpreting two digit years.
